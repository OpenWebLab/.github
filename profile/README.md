## About OpenWebLab
**OpenWebLab** is an **open-source organization** dedicated to advancing the **Semantic Web, SOLID OS, Linked Data, RDF, SPARQL, and JSON-LD** ecosystem.  

We focus on building **developer tools, playgrounds, and migration solutions** to help developers, researchers, and organizations **learn, experiment, and implement Semantic Web technologies** seamlessly.

### Our Mission

- Assist in **migrating traditional ERPs and applications** into SOLID-compliant systems.  
- Share **tutorials, guides, and open-source projects** for learning and practicing Semantic Web technologies.  
- Build a **community of developers and researchers** around open, decentralized, and semantic web standards.
